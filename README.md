## Project name

CherrySafe

## Overview

CherrySafe is a Gnosis-based multi-signature wallet management tool built on Ethereum and its L2 ZK networks, which fits in the category of Ethereum infrastructure products. The funds in the multi-signature wallets can be deposited into any lending protocol or DEX via CherrySafe, in a bid to generate yield of the funds in the multi-sig vault. 


## Solving the problems

Fund management is the core module of various DAO organizations, managing community funds in the form of multiple signatures. However, the functionality of the existing multi-signature wallet system is still too simple, and CherrySafe can generate revenue from the money in the wallet to increase the liquidity of other existing protocols.

## Method

1.When the gnosis-safe multi-signature wallet system is established, all its parameters are fixed, such as the multi-signature address and control parameters, they are all set and cannot be upgraded. However, our system allows two improvements. First, the existing multi-signature signers can be changed; second, the multi-signature control parameters can be altered. For example, 3/6 control parameters can be changed to 4/9. In this way, the upgradeability of the DAO multi-signature wallet is realized.

2.By establishing Defi controller, we can deposit the funds of multi-signature wallet into various DeFi protocols, so that the funds in the multi-signature wallet can increase in value and gain additional income. That is also a major innovation

## Features and specialties

1.You can add liquidity to a decentralized exchange by adding funds from the multi-signature wallet.
2.You can also put the money in your wallet into the loan agreement, so as to obtain financial benefits
